# Azure API Management

#### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to enhance your coding workflow by leveraging Azure’s API Management tools. You will gain hands-on experience in setting up and verifying an API Management instance, deploying and customizing the Developer Portal, and managing user experience and product definitions. The lab will guide you through creating and integrating APIs, working with existing APIs like the Star Wars API, importing APIs using OpenAPI, and managing testing, subscription keys, and rate limits. Additionally, you’ll configure policy expressions, handle API versions and revisions, implement analytics and monitoring tools, and establish security measures. The integration of Fusion Dev tools and the design of a scalable, secure API management architecture will also be covered, equipping you with the skills to optimize your API development and management processes effectively.

## Objective
By the end of this lab, you will improve your coding workflow by leveraging AI-powered tools. You will:
   - **Create an API Management Instance**: Set up and verify an Azure API Management instance in your environment.
   - **Developer Portal**: Deploy and customize the Developer Portal, configure email settings, and manage user experience and product definitions.
   - **Adding APIs**: Create new APIs, integrate with existing ones (e.g., Star Wars API), import APIs using OpenAPI, and manage testing, subscription keys, and rate limits.
   - **Policy Expressions**: Configure and implement policy expressions to control API behavior and enforce rules.
   - **Version and Revisions**: Handle API versions and revisions for updates and compatibility.
   - **Analytics & Monitoring**: Implement tools for tracking API performance and usage.
   - **Security**: Integrate and utilize Fusion Dev tools for enhanced API management and development.
   - **Fusion Dev**: Integrate and utilize Fusion Dev tools for enhanced API management and development.
   - **Architecture Design Session**: Design and plan the architecture of your API Management setup, focusing on scalability, security, and performance.
