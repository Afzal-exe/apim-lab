## Version and Revisions

Versions and revisions provide you with an elegant way to manage change and the lifecycle of your APIs. [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/versions-revisions/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/versions-revisions/)

Revisions allow you to safely make non-breaking changes to your API. Developers who consume the API can be given details about the changes. Revisions also allow you to rollback changes.
